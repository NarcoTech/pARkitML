## Introduction

pARkit is an innovative parking solution that leverages Augmented Reality (AR) technology to simplify and optimize the parking experience. One of the key features of pARkit is dynamic pricing, which allows us to adjust parking rates based on various factors such as demand, location, and time of day. The machine learning model in this repository is crucial for accurately predicting parking prices.

## Getting Started

To make new predictions using our pre-trained neural network model, you can use the `saved_model_prediction_nn.py` script. Here's how to get started:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/NarcoTech/pARkitML.git
2. Navigate to the NeuralNetwork directory:
   ```sh
    cd pARkitML/NeuralNetwork
4. Run the 'saved_model_prediction_nn.py' script with your input data to obtain parking price predictions.

## Dependencies
To run the prediction script, you will need the following dependencies:

1. Python 3.x
2. TensorFlow
3. NumPy
4. Pandas
5. Keras
6. joblib
